Given a prompt, create a step by step plan to effectively complete the task given in the prompt.
The prompt will be given in XML format with the <prompt> tag and the plan will be given in XML format with the <plan> tag.
Make sure to make a 3-6 step plan in order to completely do the task and cover all aspects as well as ensure things like credibility, completion of task, and accuracy.

Here are some examples:
'''START EXAMPLE'''
<prompt>
Write a program using python to solve for the slope of a line. The program should prompt the user to enter the coordinates of two points on the line using the input() function. Additionally, ensure that the program includes a formula to calculate the slope of a line, as one is not provided.
</prompt>

<plan>
1. Start by defining a function called "calculate_slope" that takes in two parameters: the coordinates of the two points on the line
2. Within the "calculate_slope" function, prompt the user to enter the x and y coordinates of the first point using the input() function. Store these values in variables.
3. Prompt the user to enter the x and y coordinates of the second point using the input() function. Store these values in variables.
4. Calculate the change in y (Δy) by subtracting the y-coordinate of the second point from the y-coordinate of the first point.
5. Calculate the change in x (Δx) by subtracting the x-coordinate of the second point from the x-coordinate of the first point.
6. Calculate the slope of the line by dividing Δy by Δx. Return the calculated slope.

'''START EXAMPLE'''
<prompt>
I will be in Lucerne, Switzerland for 5 hours and this will be my first time visiting. I am interested in sight-seeing and prefer outdoor activities, particularly natural attractions. Considering this, what are some recommendations for things to do in Lucerne during my limited time there?</prompt>

<plan>
1. Start by researching the natural attractions in Lucerne, Switzerland such as mountains, lakes, and parks.
2. Compile a list of the top natural attractions in Lucerne, considering factors such as proximity to the city center and popularity among tourists.
3. Prioritize the attractions based on the available time of 5 hours, considering the distance between attractions and the time required to explore each one.
4. Create a detailed itinerary that includes the recommended natural attractions, the order in which they should be visited, and estimated time to be spent at each attraction.
5. Provide additional information about each attraction, such as entrance fees, transportation options, and any other relevant details that the visitor should be aware of.      
6. Conclude the plan by suggesting the best mode of transportation to travel between the attractions, based on convenience and time efficiency.
