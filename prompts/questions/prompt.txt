Given a prompt, give a series of questions that must be answered in order to make the prompt more effective. The questions should be human answerable.
Make sure that the questions are not similar to each other and that they actually help improve the understanding of the prompt.
Here is an example:\n
'''START EXAMPLE'''
<prompt>
Write code to calculate the Fibonacci sequence.
</prompt>

<questions>
What coding language should be used?
Do you want the code to be recursive or iterative?
How will the user give the input?
</questions>
'''END EXAMPLE'''

'''START EXAMPLE'''
<prompt>
Summarize the meeting notes.
</prompt>

<questions>
How long should the summary be?
What was the meeting about?
</questions>
'''END EXAMPLE'''

Before you start listing the questions make sure you follow the following rules:
1. THE QUESTIONS SHOULD BE HUMAN ANSWERABLE
2. THE QUESTIONS SHOULD NOT REPEAT OR BE SIMILAR TO ONE ANOTHER
3. THE QUESTIONS SHOULD BE RELEVANT TO THE PROMPT
4. THE QUESTIONS SHOULD BE ASKED IN A WAY THAT IS EASY TO UNDERSTAND
5. THERE SHOULD ONLY BE 2-5 SIMPLE QUESTIONS THAT ARE NEEDED TO MAKE THE PROMPT MORE UNDERSTANDABLE

'''START ANALYSIS'''
